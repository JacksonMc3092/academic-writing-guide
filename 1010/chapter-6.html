          Research is not “collecting quotes.” It’s finding the best conversation partners for your question

        <h2 id="intro-title">I. Introduction: Why research exists</h2>

        <p>
          Research exists because none of us can know everything firsthand. Academic writing asks you to build
          a claim that can survive contact with reality — evidence, context, and other informed viewpoints.
          A strong source is not just “credible.” It’s also <em>useful</em> for the specific job your paper is doing.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Your goal in this chapter</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Start with a <strong>working question</strong> (not a vague topic).</li>
            <li>Search in smart places (not just one place).</li>
            <li>Evaluate quickly and realistically using <strong>SIFT</strong> (Stop, Investigate, Find better coverage, Trace).</li>
            <li>Track what you find using a <strong>source log</strong>.</li>
            <li>Begin MLA basics now — then deepen in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Bridge to Chapter 9 (Topic → Thesis)</strong>
          <p>
            Think of your <strong>working question</strong> as your steering wheel. It keeps your research from turning into
            random browsing. Later, when you move into the <strong>topic → working thesis</strong> work in Chapter 9, your question
            becomes the fuel for a claim: what you learned, what’s at stake, and what you want your reader to believe.
            (See Chapter 9: <a href="/1010/chapter-9.html">Crafting Powerful Thesis Statements</a>.)

      <section id="starting-right" aria-labelledby="start-title">
        <h2 id="start-title">II. Starting Right: Question first, then keywords</h2>

        <h3>1) Turn a topic into a working question</h3>
        <p>
          A topic is a territory. A working question is a route. It tells you what to look for and how to decide
          whether a source actually helps.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Topic → Working Question examples</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Topic:</strong> Social media and mental health<br />
              <strong>Working question:</strong> How does heavy social media use affect anxiety in first-year college students, and what interventions show evidence of helping?</li>
            <li><strong>Topic:</strong> AI in school writing<br />
              <strong>Working question:</strong> When students use generative AI for drafting, what changes in learning outcomes are documented, and what policies reduce harm without banning tools outright?</li>
            <li><strong>Topic:</strong> Food deserts<br />
              <strong>Working question:</strong> Which solutions measurably improve fresh-food access: new grocery stores, mobile markets, or transportation support — and under what conditions?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>2) Build keyword “families” (not one magic phrase)</h3>
        <p>
          Most students search like this: one phrase, one time, hope for miracles. Instead, build keyword families you can swap in and out.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Keyword family template</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Core terms:</strong> the main topic words (e.g., “social media,” “anxiety”)</li>
            <li><strong>Synonyms:</strong> alternate words (e.g., “Instagram,” “stress,” “mental health”)</li>
            <li><strong>Academic terms:</strong> discipline language (e.g., “problematic use,” “generalized anxiety disorder”)</li>
            <li><strong>Limiters:</strong> population/place/time (e.g., “first-year,” “college,” “United States,” “2020–2026”)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">Tip: your keywords get better as you read. Research is allowed to be iterative. (That’s the point.)</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="where-to-search" aria-labelledby="search-title">
        <h2 id="search-title">III. Where to Search: Three lanes that work</h2>

        <p>
          You’re not choosing between “library” and “Google.” You’re choosing the right lane for the job.
          Most strong research blends all three.
        </p>

        <h3>Lane 1: Library databases (best for peer-reviewed scholarship)</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>Use when you need: scholarly articles, academic books/chapters, credible reports.</li>
          <li>Best move: start broad, then narrow using subject terms, filters, and date ranges.</li>
          <li>Reality check: you may need 1–2 scholarly sources plus other credible sources (policy, journalism, data) depending on your assignment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lane 2: Google Scholar (best for citation trails)</h3>
        <p>
          Google Scholar is powerful because it shows you a network: newer work that cites something, related work, and multiple versions.
          Scholar itself recommends using “Cited by,” “Related articles,” and “All versions” to keep exploring efficiently (Google Scholar Search Help).
        </p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li><strong>“Cited by”</strong> = newer work that references the item you found.</li>
          <li><strong>“Related articles”</strong> = similar work (a fast way to expand).</li>
          <li><strong>“All versions”</strong> = alternate locations, sometimes including free PDFs.</li>
          <li><strong>Library links</strong> = connect to your college subscriptions (if configured).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Important warning about auto-generated citations</strong>
          <p>
            Tools that generate citations (including Scholar’s “Cite” button) are helpful, but not perfect. Use them as a draft,
            then check your details against MLA rules (MLA Style Center; Purdue OWL).
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Lane 3: The open web (best for context, policy, and credible public sources)</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>Use when you need: government data, nonprofit reports, reputable journalism, organizational statements, primary documents.</li>
          <li>Best move: evaluate quickly using lateral reading/SIFT before you commit time to close reading.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="evaluate" aria-labelledby="evaluate-title">
        <h2 id="evaluate-title">IV. Evaluating Sources: Credible isn’t enough — it must also be useful</h2>

        <h3>1) Use SIFT for a fast credibility check</h3>
        <p>
          SIFT is designed to help you evaluate sources quickly and avoid getting trapped by polished design or confident tone.
          The Center for an Informed Public describes SIFT as a four-step method developed by Mike Caulfield: <strong>Stop</strong>, <strong>Investigate</strong>,
          <strong>Find better coverage</strong>, and <strong>Trace</strong> claims/media back to the original (Center for an Informed Public).
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>SIFT in student-language</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Pause when you feel pulled in. Strong emotion is a signal to slow down.</li>
            <li><strong>Investigate the source:</strong> Who are they? What’s their mission? What do reliable places say about them?</li>
            <li><strong>Find better coverage:</strong> Is this claim supported by more trustworthy outlets or research?</li>
            <li><strong>Trace:</strong> Follow the claim to the original study, document, quote, or dataset.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>2) Why “lateral reading” beats close reading at the start</h3>
        <p>
          When people evaluate a source by staying on the page (scrolling, checking the About page, admiring the logo), they often get fooled.
          Research on expert fact-checkers shows they “read laterally”: they leave the site quickly and open new tabs to check what other sources say
          (Wineburg and McGrew; Caulfield).
        </p>

        <h3>3) The usefulness check (with a concrete example)</h3>
        <p>
          A source can be credible and still be wrong for your paper. Before you adopt a source, run four quick questions:
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Usefulness check</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Does it actually address my working question?</li>
            <li><strong>Level:</strong> Is it too general or too specialized for what I need right now?</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> What job will it do in my paper (background, evidence, counterargument, definition, method, example)?</li>
            <li><strong>Conversation:</strong> Does it help me join a real discussion (not just repeat a point)? (ACRL Framework)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Mini example (usefulness in action)</strong>
          <p>
            Let’s say your working question is: <em>“How does social media use affect anxiety in first-year college students?”</em>
          </p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>You find a credible article about teen anxiety and TikTok. It’s interesting, but your population is different. That might become <strong>background context</strong>, not your core evidence.</li>
            <li>You find a peer-reviewed study on <strong>college students</strong> and anxiety that includes a clear method and findings. That’s a strong candidate for <strong>evidence</strong>.</li>
            <li>You find an opinion piece from a tech CEO. It may be relevant as a <strong>stakeholder viewpoint</strong>, but it isn’t research evidence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">Same topic, different jobs. Usefulness is about rhetorical purpose, not vibes.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="manage-cite" aria-labelledby="manage-title">
        <h2 id="manage-title">V. Managing &amp; Citing: Source logs + MLA basics (with a preview of Chapter 7)</h2>

        <h3>1) Use a source log so your research doesn’t vanish</h3>
        <p>
          A source log is a simple system for tracking what you found, why it matters, and how you’ll use it.
          It keeps you from “PDF hoarding” and makes drafting faster.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Source log template (copy/paste and reuse)</strong>
          <div class="mini">Pro tip: fill this out while you search, not after you forget everything.</div>

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>2) MLA basics: in-text citations + Works Cited</h3>
        <p>
          MLA is not just formatting. It’s how your reader sees your evidence trail. The basic rule is:
          <strong>when you use someone else’s words or ideas, you cite them in the sentence and in your Works Cited</strong>.
          Purdue OWL describes MLA as an author-page in-text citation system (Purdue OWL).

          <strong>In-text citation basics (MLA)</strong>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>If you name the author in the sentence, put the page number in parentheses: <br />
              <em>Smith argues that … (42).</em></li>
            <li>If you don’t name the author in the sentence, include the author and page: <br />
              <em>… in college writing (Smith 42).</em></li>
            <li>If there’s no page number (common on web pages), MLA has alternate approaches — your instructor will tell you what to prioritize. (Start with MLA Style Center.)</li>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Preview: Chapter 7 and Chapter 8</strong>
          <p>
            Chapter 6 gets you the sources. Chapter 7 helps you integrate them cleanly (signal phrases, quoting, paraphrasing, citation placement).
            Chapter 8 helps you use sources rhetorically — not as “supporting decorations,” but as part of your argument and synthesis.
