                    According to a decade-long University of Michigan study, a strong connection exists between a community's funding of its public libraries and several beneficial community results. These include increased voting, better student performance, and reduced youth crime, indicating that libraries act as vital centers for community involvement.

                    <strong>Original Passage:</strong><br>
                    "A comprehensive analysis of urban green spaces in major metropolitan areas reveals a significant correlation between park accessibility and community health outcomes. The study, which surveyed over 10,000 residents, found that neighborhoods with higher park density reported 20% lower rates of stress-related illnesses and 15% higher levels of reported physical activity. Researchers conclude that urban planning policies must prioritize equitable access to green spaces as a public health imperative."

                    "This article is about parks in cities. It says that parks are good and make people healthier, which isn't surprising. They think we should build more of them."

                        <li><strong>Source 2 (Journal Article):</strong> "A significant challenge to implementing active learning is student resistance. Learners accustomed to lecture-based formats may perceive group work as a failure of the instructor to 'teach' them properly."</li>
                        <li><strong>Source 3 (Blog Post by a Teaching Expert):</strong> "The effectiveness of active learning is not in the technique itself, but in its implementation. Clear explanation of the why behind the activity and scaffolding the skills for collaboration are essential for success."</li>

                <p>Summary and synthesis skills are essential across many academic assignments and will serve you throughout your professional career. Here's how to apply them effectively in both contexts.</p>
                
                <h3>Academic Applications</h3>

                <div class="tools-note">
                    <p><strong>The Annotated Bibliography</strong></p>
                    <p>A perfect training ground for summary. Each entry is a concise summary of a source, often followed by a brief reflection on its usefulness for your specific project.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tools-note">
                    <p><strong>The Literature Review</strong></p>
                    <p>The heart of synthesis. A literature review is never just a list of summaries. It's a synthesized conversation where you organize sources by theme, debate, or methodology to reveal a gap in the research that your project will address.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tools-note">
                    <p><strong>The Research Paper</strong></p>
                    <p>Every body paragraph of a strong research paper is an act of synthesis. You state your claim, present evidence from your sources, and explain how that evidence works together to prove your point.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Professional Applications Across Disciplines</h3>
                <p>The ability to distill complex information and combine ideas from multiple sources is valuable in virtually every profession. Here's how these skills translate to different fields:</p>
